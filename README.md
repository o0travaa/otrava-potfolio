# welcome to my portfolio for work :)
*This repository is a portfolio for my work. There's nothing here yet, but I plan to add my solo projects soon. Currently, I'm learning Rust and have learned the basics of C; I want to learn many other languages as well. I particularly love back-end development. I'm a beginner in programming.
